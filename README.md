Platform Your Face Off
============
I created this game during my second semester of college. It is very similar to Icy Tower. You must platform all the way to
the top but the level is rendered randomly each time so you never know what your gonna get. The game ends once you reach a score of 600 but trust me this is not eas challenge. Play as classic charactars: megaman, link, contra, and ninja gaiden. Enjoy!

Download
============
To download and play the game simply download the .jar file and the assets folder. Once both are downloaded place them in the saem directory and then run the executable jar file. You're computer should enter full screen mode and the game should begin to run!
