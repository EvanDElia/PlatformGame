Platform Your Face Off
============
I created this game during my second semester of college. It is very similar to Icy Tower. You must platform all the way to
the top but the level is rendered randomly each time so you never know what your gonna get. The game ends once you reach a score of 600 but trust me this is not eas challenge. Play as classic charactars: megaman, link, contra, and ninja gaiden. Enjoy!

Download
============
To download and play the game simply download the compressed .zip file. This file contains an executable jar file and a copy of the game's assets. Simply extract both the jar and the assets folder into the same directory and then run the jar.
