Platform Your Face Off
============
I created this game during my second semester of college. It is very similar to Icy Tower. You must platform all the way to
the top but the level is rendered randomly each time so you never know what your gonna get. The game ends once you reach a score of 600 but trust me this is not an easy challenge. Play as classic charactars: megaman, link, contra, and ninja gaiden. Enjoy!

Download
============
To download and play the game simply change to the download branch of this project and click the button in the lower right corner of github which says "Download Zip" once you have downloaded both the .jar file and the assets folder, unpack/copy them out of the zip folder and place them in the same folder on your computer. Now simply run the jar file and the game should begin playing in full screen mode.
